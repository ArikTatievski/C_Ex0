# What is this project?

This project is the low key of C programing.

We are making 4 simple functions : isPrime, isArmstrong, isPolyndrome, isStrong (All are mathmatics figures)

And a MAKEFILE that knows to take the C files and turn them into whatever we want (static library, dynamic library, recursion functions, regular functions, a few mains each is diffrent than the other)

and we have our main that is the most low-key function that accepts 2 params and does all 4 functions on the range from [num1,num2]

# How to activate

Please open a Linux enviroment (or use bash on cmd) and type "make all", after that all the files will apear and you will have to open the ./exe file

Hope you enjoy my writings and find good usage to them :)
